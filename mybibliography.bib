Casting these two schemes as Galerkin approximations of the same variational problem allows us to assert their well-posedness and convergence. More importantly, we extend in this work their domains of application, by relieving some stringent conditions on the reference material which were previously thought necessary. The origins of the ﬂaws of each scheme are identiﬁed, and a third scheme is proposed, which seems to combine the strengths of the basic and energy-based schemes, while leaving out their weaknesses. Finally, a rule is proposed for handling heterogeneous pixels/voxels, a situation frequently met when images of real materials are used as input to these schemes.},

In this work, we investigate the beneﬁts of nonlinear conjugate gradient (CG) methods in the context of FFT-based computational micromechanics. Traditionally, nonlinear CG methods require dedicated line-search procedures to be efﬁcient, rendering them not competitive in the FFT-based context. We contribute to nonlinear CG methods devoid of line searches by exploiting similarities between nonlinear CG methods and accelerated gradient methods. More precisely, by letting the step-size go to zero, we exhibit the Fletcher–Reeves nonlinear CG as a dynamical system with state-dependent nonlinear damping. We show how to implement nonlinear CG methods for FFT-based computational micromechanics, and demonstrate by numerical experiments that the Fletcher–Reeves nonlinear CG represents a competitive, memory-efﬁcient and parameter-choice free solution method for linear and nonlinear homogenization problems, which, in addition, decreases the residual monotonically.},

In this work we discuss FFT-based homogenization for elastic problems at large deformations, with a focus on the following improvements. Firstly, we exhibit the fixed point method introduced by Moulinec and Suquet for small deformations as a gradient descent method. Secondly, we propose a Newton–Krylov method for large deformations. We give an example for which this methods needs approximately 20 times less iterations than Newton’s method using linear fixed point solvers and roughly \$\$100\$\$100 times less iterations than the nonlinear fixed point method. However, the Newton–Krylov method requires 4 times more storage than the nonlinear fixed point scheme. Exploiting the special structure we introduce a memory-efficient version with 40 \% memory saving. Thirdly, we give an analytical solution for the micromechanical solution field of a two-phase isotropic St.Venant–Kirchhoff laminate. We use this solution for comparison and validation, but it is of independent interest. As an example for a microstructure relevant in engineering we discuss finally the application of the FFT-based method to glass fiber reinforced polymer structures.},

	abstract = {Abstract The Fourier–Galerkin method (in short FFTH) has gained popularity in numerical homogenisation because it can treat problems with a huge number of degrees of freedom. Because the method incorporates the fast Fourier transform (FFT) in the linear solver, it is believed to provide an improvement in computational and memory requirements compared to the conventional finite element method (FEM). Here, we systematically compare these two methods using the energetic norm of local fields, which has the clear physical interpretation as being the error in the homogenised properties. This enables the comparison of memory and computational requirements at the same level of approximation accuracy. We show that the methods’ effectiveness relies on the smoothness (regularity) of the solution and thus on the material coefficients. Thanks to its approximation properties, FEM outperforms FFTH for problems with jumps in material coefficients, while ambivalent results are observed for the case that the material coefficients vary continuously in space. FFTH profits from a good conditioning of the linear system, independent of the number of degrees of freedom, but generally needs more degrees of freedom to reach the same approximation accuracy. More studies are needed for other FFT-based schemes, non-linear problems, and dual problems (which require special treatment in FEM but not in FFTH).},

The problems lead to nonlinear differential equations that are typically second order in space and first order in time. This combination of nonlinearity and nonlocality makes such problems difficult to solve in parallel. However, this combination is a result of collapsing nonlocal, but linear and universal physical laws (kinematic compatibility, balance laws), and nonlinear but local constitutive relations. We propose an operator-splitting scheme inspired by this structure. The governing equations are formulated as (incremental) variational problems, the differential constraints like compatibility are introduced using an augmented Lagrangian, and the resulting incremental variational principle is solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers. The resulting algorithm has a natural connection to physical principles, and also enables massively parallel implementation on structured grids. We present this method and use it to study two examples. The first concerns the long wavelength instability of finite elasticity, and allows us to verify the approach against previous numerical simulations. We also use this example to study convergence and parallel performance. The second example concerns microstructure evolution in liquid crystal elastomers and provides new insights into some counter-intuitive properties of these materials. We use this example to validate the model and the approach against experimental observations.},

It follows from this variational format that the ensuing system of linear equations can be solved by general-purpose iterative algorithms for symmetric positive-definite systems, such as the Richardson, the Conjugate gradient, and the Chebyshev algorithms, that are compared here to the Eyre-Milton scheme - the most efficient specialized method currently available. Our numerical experiments, carried out for two-dimensional elliptic problems, reveal that the Conjugate gradient algorithm is the most efficient option, while the Eyre-Milton method performs comparably to the Chebyshev semi-iteration. The Richardson algorithm, equivalent to the still widely used original Moulinec-Suquet solver, exhibits the slowest convergence.

	abstract = {Multi-phase materials are of great importance for engineering applications, because of their favorable combination of strength and ductility. This unique combination of properties enables lightweight yet safe design for instance in the automotive industry. The in-depth understanding of the mechanical properties of these materials is thus necessary in enabling future environmentally friendly designs. The multi-phase materials studied throughout this thesis obtain their strength and ductility by combining two or more phases with distinct mechanical and failure properties. The phases are thereby dispersed throughout the microstructure, often resulting in a complex morphology. This entails significant scientific challenges for the understanding and characterization of the resulting mechanical properties, in particular in the damage and fracture regime. In fact, although single phase materials are well understood, many apparent contradictory observations have been reported for multi-phase materials. This can be overcome using a systematic micromechanical study. However, this is a non-trivial objective, neither experimentally nor computationally, since many microstructures have to be transparently compared to unravel the worst-case scenario. To facilitate a statistical study that includes many realizations of the microstructure, this thesis includes only the basic mechanical and morphological features. This way, the influence of the spatial arrangement of phases on fracture initiation is transparently qualified and quantified. It furthermore enables the systematic identification of the role of the relative amount of phases, of the contrast in their mechanical properties, and of the macroscopic stress state. Exploiting these first results, more complicated microstructures are studied: through simulations in two and three dimensions, and directly through experiments. The basic model is established by assuming a microstructure that consists of two phases; a soft and ductile matrix reinforced with a hard and brittle phase. The morphology is idealized, whereby the microstructure is constructed from equi-sized cells which are randomly assigned the properties of the soft or the hard phase. Damage is modeled using simple indicators which predict failure of individual cells (or "grains"). These simplifications with respect to reality enable a systematic study in which: (1) the computations are fast, allowing a statistical comparison of many different microstructures and parameters, (2) variations in terms of volume fraction are well controlled, and (3) the identification of the average distribution of phases around fracture initiation sites is well defined and transparent. The extension to three dimensions is feasible, in particular when the simple model is paired with an efficient spectral solver. To enable the treatment of arbitrary non-linear problems, this thesis includes improvements tot the spectral solver that result in robust convergence. The results show that damage initiation occurs where regions of the hard phase, aligned with tension, are interrupted by bands of the soft phase in the directions of shear. At this intersection, The hard phase triggers high hydrostatic tensile stresses, while giving sufficient room for the shear bands in the soft phase resulting in a high plastic strain. The results of the two- and three-dimensional microstructures are qualitatively consistent. A difference is that the local strain partitioning between the two phases is over-predicted by a two-dimensional microstructure, leading to an overestimation of damage. A similar statistical analysis has been performed directly on experimentally obtained micrographs, revealing a similar mechanism. Observed differences are due to the different statistical properties of the real material and the simple microstructures used in the simulations. This is shown through simulations based directly on micrographs. The two-dimensional model is used to consider large range parameter variations. Depending on the stress triaxiality it is observed that generally one of the phases dominates macroscopic fracture initiation: at low stress triaxiality the soft phase dominates, whereas the hard phase dominates above a critical triaxiality. In the latter regime, a strong decrease in ductility results. The transition between the two regimes is strongly dependent on microstructural parameters. If the hard phase volume fraction is small, the fracture initiation is dominated by the soft phase even at high phase contrast. At higher hard phase volume fraction, the hard phase dominates already for a low phase contrast. This simple model thereby reconciles experimental observations from the literature. Beyond the stage of void nucleation, early nucleated voids start influencing the sequel of damage mechanisms. It is found that, at a certain strain level, voids start to link up along a percolating path of soft phase aligned with the directions of shear. The relative spatial positions of the early voids thereby determine whether the onset of final fracture occurs early or at a substantially large strain. Hence, the macroscopically observed failure is largely predetermined by the microstructure. The nucleation of voids is determined by the local arrangement of the phases, while damage propagation is controlled on a longer length-scale relying on a critical relative position of "initiation hot-spot". Although more research is needed to validate the conclusions of this thesis for more realistic microstructures and different load cases, by performing a systematic analysis this thesis has contributed to the state of the art for multi-phase metals. Additionally, the proposed statistical perspective may assist systematic and objective analyses of other micromechanical phenomena in the future.},

	abstract = {Abstract Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based methods are becoming increasingly popular for modeling the texture evolution and local mechanical response of polycrystalline materials within the representative volume element (RVE). Originally, the FFT-based method was formulated through the Lippman–Schwinger (L–S) equation in terms of a homogeneous elastic reference medium. More recently, the Fourier–Galerkin method was proposed to discretize the RVE weak form independently of the reference medium using trigonometric polynomials. The Fourier–Galerkin method, albeit efficient and robust, has not been extended to solve crystal plasticity (CP) problems with spatial heterogeneity and fine resolution. Also, its algorithmic homogenization has not yet been investigated, which is essential for concurrent multiscale modeling. In this paper, a general framework is proposed that connects the FFT-based method and objective rate constitutive models, in particular a generalized implementation of crystal plasticity. Consistent linearization is achieved by pulling back the tangent stiffness from unrotated configuration to reference configuration, which improves the convergence behavior of the Newton–Krylov solver. Applying the inexact Newton method further improves the numerical efficiency. Also, the algorithmic homogenized tangent stiffness for the Fourier–Galerkin method is derived to enable mixed boundary conditions and concurrent multiscale modeling. Lastly, the Fourier–Galerkin method’s accuracy and efficiency for solving CP problems are studied in a parallelized environment, and significant speedup is observed versus the finite element method and L–S based FFT method.},

In this work, we generalize the method to problems discretized by trilinear hexahedral elements on Cartesian grids and physically nonlinear elasticity problems. We present an implementation of the basic scheme that reduces the memory requirements by a factor of four and of the conjugate gradient scheme that reduces the storage necessary by a factor of nine compared with a naive implementation. For benchmark problems in linear elasticity, the solver exhibits mesh- and contrast-independent convergence behavior and enables the computational homogenization of complex structures, for instance, arising from computed tomography computed tomography (CT) imaging techniques. There exist 3D microstructures involving pores and defects, for which the original FFT-based homogenization scheme does not converge. In contrast, for the proposed scheme, convergence is ensured. Also, the solution fields are devoid of the spurious oscillations and checkerboarding artifacts associated to conventional schemes. We demonstrate the power of the approach by computing the elasto-plastic response of a long-fiber reinforced thermoplastic material with 172 × 106 (displacement) degrees of freedom.

Our method shares some properties with the FFT-based homogenization technique of Moulinec and Suquet, which has received widespread attention recently because of its robustness and computational speed. These similarities include the use of FFT and the resulting performing solvers. The staggered grid discretization, however, offers three crucial improvements. Firstly, solutions obtained by our method are completely devoid of the spurious oscillations characterizing solutions obtained by Moulinec–Suquet's discretization. Secondly, the iteration numbers of our solvers are bounded independently of the grid size and the contrast. In particular, our solvers converge for three-dimensional porous structures, which cannot be handled by Moulinec–Suquet's method. Thirdly, the finite difference discretization allows for algorithmic variants with lower memory consumption. More precisely, it is possible to reduce the memory consumption of the Moulinec–Suquet algorithms by 50\%. We underline the effectiveness and the applicability of our methods by several numerical experiments of industrial scale. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

It is shown that the easy use of the conventional continuous Fourier transform of the modified Green operator ( C G O approximation) for heterogeneous materials with eigenstrains leads to spurious oscillations when computing the local responses of composite materials close to materials discontinuities like interfaces, dislocations. In this paper, we also focus on the calculation of the displacement field and its associated discrete Green operator which may be useful for materials characterization methods like diffraction techniques. We show that the development of these new consistent discrete Green operators in the Fourier space named “Discrete Green Operators” ( D G O ) allows to eliminate oscillations while retaining similar convergence capability. For illustration, a D G O for strain-based modified Green tensor is implemented in an iterative algorithm for heterogeneous periodic composites with eigenstrain fields. Numerical examples are reported, such as the computation of the local stresses and displacements of composite materials with homogeneous or heterogeneous elasticity combined with dilatational eigenstrain or eigenstrain representing prismatic dislocation loops. The numerical stress and displacement solutions obtained with the D G O are calculated for cubic-shaped inclusions, spherical Eshelby and inhomogeneity problems. The results are discussed and compared with analytical solutions and the classic discretization method using the C G O .},

For this, achieving the highest possible spatial resolution is advantageous, in order to capture the intricate details of complex microstructures. Spectral methods, as an efficient alternative to the widely used finite element method (FEM), have been established during the last decade and their applicability to the case of polycrystalline materials has already been demonstrated. However, until now, the existing implementations were limited to infinitesimal strain and phenomenological crystal elasto-viscoplasticity. This work presents the extension of the existing spectral formulation for polycrystals to the case of finite strains, not limited to a particular constitutive law, by considering a general material model implementation. By interfacing the exact same material model to both, the new spectral implementation as well as a FEM-based solver, a direct comparison of both numerical strategies is possible. Carrying out this comparison, and using a phenomenological constitutive law as example, we demonstrate that the spectral method solution converges much faster with mesh/grid resolution, fulfills stress equilibrium and strain compatibility much better, and is able to solve the micromechanical problem for, e.g. , a 256 3 grid in comparable times as required by a 64 3 mesh of linear finite elements.},

The latter approach, fully equivalent to the original Moulinec–Suquet algorithm, was used to evaluate guaranteed upper–lower bounds on homogenized coefficients incorporating a closed-form double-grid quadrature. Here, these concepts, based on the primal and dual formulations, are employed for the Ga scheme. For the same computational effort, the Ga outperforms the GaNi with more accurate guaranteed bounds and more predictable numerical behaviors. The quadrature technique leading to block-sparse linear systems is extended here to materials defined via high-resolution images in a way that allows for effective treatment using the FFT. Memory demands are reduced by a reformulation of the double-grid scheme to the original grid scheme using FFT shifts. Minimization of the bounds during iterations of conjugate gradients is effective, particularly when incorporating a solution from a coarser grid.

	abstract = {Abstract FFT-based homogenization methods aim at calculating the effective behavior of heterogeneous materials with periodic microstructures. These methods operate on a regular grid of voxels, and hence require an appropriate spatial discretization of periodic microstructures. However, when different microstructural length scales are involved, it is not always possible to have sufficient spatial resolutions to explicitly consider the influence of fine microstructural features (e.g. voids, second-phase particles). To circumvent this difficulty, one solution consists of using composite voxel methods to define the effective properties and the effective internal variables of heterogeneous voxels. In this work, different composite voxel methods are proposed to deal with inelastic materials with multiple length scales. These methods use simple homogenization rules to calculate the effective behavior of heterogeneous voxels. The first part of this paper is dedicated to the description of the composite voxel methods, which are based either on the Voigt, laminate structure or Mori–Tanaka approximations. In the second part, these methods are used to model the elasto-plastic behavior of a pearlitic steel polycrystalline aggregate. According to the results, the Voigt approximation, which ignores morphological features, is not appropriate for treating heterogeneous voxels. When morphological information is accounted for, with either the laminate structure or Mori–Tanaka approximations, a better agreement with experimental observations is obtained. Though none of these methods is universal, they offer some possibilities to investigate the mechanical behavior of heterogeneous materials involving multiple length scales.},

The numerical method proposed by Moulinec \& Suquet lies on the iterative resolution of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation and can be summarized by the following relation between two successive iterates e i and e i+1 of the strain field: e i+1 (x) = −Γ 0 * (c(x) − c 0) : e i (x) + E , where c 0 is the stiffness tensor of a reference medium supposed to be linear elastic, where Γ 0 is a Green operator associated to c 0 and where * denotes the convolution operator. Eyre \& Milton [2], Michel et al. [3] and Monchiet \& Bonnet [4] proposed different schemes to accelerate the convergence of the initial scheme. It has been recently demonstrated in [5] that the two first schemes are particular cases of the last one. On the other hand, Zeman et al. [6] proposed to use a conjugate gradient method for solving the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. The present paper aims to compare these different methods with a special attention paid to their relative efficiency and their rates of convergence.},

	abstract = {Abstract Spectral methods using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithms have recently seen a surge in interest in the mechanics of materials community. The present contribution addresses the critical question of determining accurate local mechanical fields using FFT methods without artificial fluctuations arising from materials and defects induced discontinuities. Precisely, the present work introduces a numerical approach based on intrinsic discrete Fourier transforms for the simultaneous treatment of material discontinuities arising from the presence of dislocations and from elastic stiffness heterogeneities. To this end, the elasto-static equations of the field dislocation mechanics theory for periodic heterogeneous materials are numerically solved with FFT in the case of dislocations in proximity of inclusions of varying stiffness. An optimal intrinsic discrete Fourier transform method is sought based on two distinct schemes. A centered finite difference scheme for differential rules are used for numerically solving the Poisson-type equation in the Fourier space, while centered finite differences on a rotated grid is chosen for the computation of the modified Fourier–Green’s operator associated with the Lippmann–Schwinger-type equation. By comparing different methods with analytical solutions for an edge dislocation in a composite material, it is found that the present spectral method is accurate, devoid of any numerical oscillation, and efficient even for an infinite phase elastic contrast like a hole embedded in a matrix containing a dislocation. The present FFT method is then used to simulate physical cases such as the elastic fields of dislocation dipoles located near the matrix/inclusion interface in a 2D composite material and the ones due to dislocation loop distributions surrounding cubic inclusions in 3D composite material. In these configurations, the spectral method allows investigating accurately the elastic interactions and image stresses due to dislocation fields in the presence of elastic inhomogeneities.},

Our approach builds on the recent variational reformulation of the Moulinec–Suquet (1994) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) homogenization scheme by Vondřejc et al. (2014), which is based on the conforming Galerkin approximation with trigonometric polynomials. Upper–lower bounds are obtained by adjusting the primal–dual finite element framework developed independently by Dvořak (1993) and Wiȩckowski (1995) to the FFT-based Galerkin setting. We show that the discretization procedure differs for odd and non-odd number of grid points. Thanks to the Helmholtz decomposition inherited from the continuous formulation, the duality structure is fully preserved for the odd discretizations. In the latter case, a more complex primal–dual structure is observed due to presence of the trigonometric polynomials associated with the Nyquist frequencies. These theoretical findings are confirmed with numerical examples. To conclude, the main advantage of the FFT-based approach over conventional finite-element schemes is that the primal and the dual problems are treated on the same basis, and this property can be extended beyond the scalar elliptic setting.},

	abstract = {All the FFT-based methods available for homogenization of the mechanical response share a common point: the unknown field is the strain/deformation gradient, second order tensors which compatibility is imposed using Green's function or projection operators. This implies the allocation of redundant information and, when the method is based in a solving a linear system, the rank-deficiency of the resulting systems. In this work we propose a new, fast, robust and memory-efficient FFT approach in which the displacement field on the Fourier space is the unknown: the displacement based FFT (DBFFT) algorithm. In the linear case, the method results in a linear equation defined in terms of linear operators in the Fourier space and that does not require a reference medium. The system has an associated full rank Hermitian matrix and can be solved using iterative Krylov solvers and allows the use of preconditioners. The method is extended to non-linear problems and strain, stress and mixed control. A preconditioner is proposed to improve the efficiency of the system resolution. Finally, some numerical examples are solved to check the accuracy and efficiency of the method. The computational cost reduction respect the Galerkin-FFT was around 30\%.},

	abstract = {Abstract In this paper, we develop a computational approach based on variational principles combined with FFT technique to determine the effective elastic properties of composite materials. The unit cell problem of the composite is recast in a weak and integral form by making use of classic variational approaches, based on the strain and the stress potential, and the Hashin–Shtrikman variational principles. The problem is discretized with Fourier series and the stationary point is computed numerically by means of an iterative scheme. These algorithms use a representation of the local elastic tensor on the double grid (twice the size of the discretization) which is introduced by the integral formulation; it advantageously accounts for the exact geometry of the microstructure and allows the derivation of rigorous bounds of the effective elasticity coefficients. In the second part of the paper, we establish a hierarchy between the different FFT solutions: the strain, the stress based solutions coming from the classic variational formulations and the polarization based solution derived from the Hashin–Shtrikman principle, which depends on the choice of the elastic moduli of the reference material. It is proved that the strain and the stress based solutions deliver optimal bounds since they are always better than those obtained from the Hashin–Shtrikman variational principle when the same discretization is used. Alternatively, when the elastic moduli of the reference material is negative, the polarization based solution provides an estimate of the effective properties which is comprised between the strain based upper bound and the stress based lower bound.},
